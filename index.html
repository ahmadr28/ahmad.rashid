            My name is Ahmad Rashid and I am 20 years old and this is my basic portfolio! My favorite pasttime as of
            right now is PC gaming and ive gotten pretty good at it. I go to school full time in Arlington and my major
            is Computer Science. I work with mu father at our family business as a social media marketer and also the 
            web developer for our website. I'm taking this course to improve and sharpen my skills. <br><br>
            I'm also really into fast cars and concept cars one of my dreams is to have a 20 car warehouse full of
            my favorite cars growing up.  <br><br>
            My goal in this field is to one day be able to code games and interaction sites like the akinator. I also
            want to learn how to program using automation becasue of the demand for that field nowadays also 
            virtual reality is gonna be the next medium for game development and i want to get in on it before it 
            skyrockets.
